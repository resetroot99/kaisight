## 🎯 **KaiSight-Specific Considerations**

### **High-Priority Review Areas**
1. **Health Data Handling** - Apple scrutinizes health apps heavily
2. **Emergency Features** - Must not interfere with actual emergency services
3. **AI/ML Models** - Ensure on-device processing claims are accurate
4. **Accessibility Claims** - Must deliver on accessibility promises
5. **Camera/Location Usage** - Clear justification for all permissions

### **Potential Review Challenges**
- **Complex Feature Set** may require detailed explanation
- **Health Claims** must be carefully worded and disclaimed
- **Emergency Services** integration needs proper disclaimers
- **AI Capabilities** should be clearly explained, not oversold
- **Bluetooth Usage** for health devices may need justification

### **Success Strategies**
- **Clear Documentation** in App Review Information
- **Video Demos** showing accessibility features in action
- **Medical Disclaimers** prominently displayed
- **User Testimonials** from beta testing (accessibility community)
- **Technical Architecture** explanation for complex features
