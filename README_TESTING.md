# BlindAssistant Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup & Testing

### 1. **Create Xcode Project**
```bash
# Create new iOS project in Xcode
# File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Project ‚Üí iOS ‚Üí App
# Name: BlindAssistant
# Language: Swift
# Interface: SwiftUI
# Minimum iOS: 15.0+
```

### 2. **Add Required Files**
Copy all the Swift files into your Xcode project:
- `ContentView.swift`
- `NavigationAssistant.swift` 
- `QuickActionsView.swift`
- `SettingsView.swift`
- `CameraManager.swift`
- `AudioManager.swift`
- `SpeechOutput.swift`
- `OfflineWhisperManager.swift`
- `ObjectDetectionManager.swift`
- `GPTManager.swift`
- `WhisperAPI.swift`

### 3. **Configure Info.plist**
Add these permissions to your `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>BlindAssistant needs camera access to describe your surroundings</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>BlindAssistant needs microphone access for voice commands</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>BlindAssistant needs location access for navigation and safety features</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>BlindAssistant needs location access for emergency features</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>BlindAssistant needs speech recognition for offline voice commands</string>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>location</string>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

### 4. **Add API Keys**
Create `Config.swift`:
```swift
struct Config {
    static let openAIAPIKey = "your-openai-api-key-here"
}
```

## üì± **Testing on Device vs Simulator**

### **Physical Device (Recommended)**
- ‚úÖ **Camera access** - Full camera functionality
- ‚úÖ **Microphone** - Real voice recording
- ‚úÖ **GPS/Location** - Actual navigation testing
- ‚úÖ **Speech Recognition** - iOS Speech framework
- ‚úÖ **Haptic feedback** - Touch feedback
- ‚úÖ **VoiceOver** - Accessibility testing

### **iOS Simulator**
- ‚ùå Camera - No physical camera
- ‚ùå Microphone - No voice input
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Location - Can simulate locations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Speech - Limited functionality
- ‚ùå Haptic - No haptic feedback

**Recommendation**: Use physical iPhone/iPad for full testing experience.

2. Info.plist permissions configured
3. iOS deployment target 15.0+
4. Missing import statements
```

### **Camera Not Working**
```bash
# Solutions:
1. Test on physical device (simulators have no camera)
2. Check camera permissions in iOS Settings
3. Verify NSCameraUsageDescription in Info.plist
4. Restart app after permission changes
```

### **Voice Commands Not Recognized**
```bash
# Debug steps:
1. Check microphone permissions
2. Test with clear speech and minimal background noise
3. Verify OpenAI API key is valid
4. Check internet connection for online mode
5. Try offline mode if online fails
```

### **GPS/Navigation Issues**
```bash
# Solutions:
1. Test outdoors for GPS signal
2. Check location permissions
3. Enable "Precise Location" in iOS Settings
4. Wait for GPS lock (may take 30+ seconds initially)
```

### **Speech Output Problems**
```bash
# Check:
1. Device volume is up
2. Test with headphones
3. Check speech settings in app Settings
4. Verify TTS permissions
5. Try different speech rates/pitches
```

## üìä **Performance Testing**

### **API Response Times**
```bash
# Monitor:
- Whisper API: Should respond in 2-5 seconds
- GPT-4 Vision: Should respond in 3-8 seconds
- Object Detection: Should complete in 1-2 seconds
- Location Services: Should update within 5 seconds
```

### **Battery Usage**
```bash
# Features that use battery:
- Continuous GPS tracking
- Camera preview
- Speech recognition
- Network requests

# Optimization tips:
- Use offline mode when possible
- Turn off app when not needed
- Monitor battery in iOS Settings
```
