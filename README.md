"Found them"                # Confirm AirPods located
"Stop searching"            # End search session
"Play sound on AirPods"     # Direct sound command
"Warmer"                    # Increase beacon frequency
"Colder"                    # Decrease beacon frequency
```

### **🎵 Audio Guidance System**

- **Phone Beacons**: System sounds for guidance when AirPods unavailable
- **Variable Timing**: 2-5 second intervals based on proximity feedback
- **Haptic Coordination**: Synchronized haptic feedback with audio cues

#### **Voice Feedback System**
- **Search Confirmation**: "Searching for your AirPods..."
- **Status Updates**: Real-time progress narration
- **Location Guidance**: "Your AirPods were last seen in the bedroom 5 minutes ago"
- **Success Confirmation**: "Great! Glad you found your AirPods"

### **📱 User Interface Integration**

#### **AirPods Status Panel**
- **Real-Time Search Status**: Live updates during search process
- **Last Known Location**: Time and room description display
- **Quick Action Buttons**: Find, Status, Stop Search controls
- **Visual Search Progress**: Status indicators for each search layer

#### **Voice Command Interface**
- **Dedicated AirPods Commands**: Separate section for AirPods-specific commands
- **Context-Aware Buttons**: Search commands disabled/enabled based on state
- **Accessibility Optimized**: Full VoiceOver support for all controls

### **🔧 Technical Implementation**

#### **CoreBluetooth Integration**
```swift
// Monitor AirPods connection status
func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didConnect peripheral: CBPeripheral) {
    if isAirPodsDevice(peripheral) {
        connectedAirPods.append(peripheral)
        recordConnectionEvent(peripheral, connected: true)
    }
}
```

#### **Location Memory System**
```swift
// Store AirPods location when disconnected
private func recordConnectionEvent(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, connected: Bool) {
    guard let currentLocation = locationManager.currentLocation else { return }
    
    if !connected {
        updateLastKnownLocation(currentLocation)
    }
}
```

#### **Find My Integration**
```swift
// Deep link to Find My app
if let findMyURL = URL(string: "findmy://") {
    UIApplication.shared.open(findMyURL) { success in
        // Handle Find My app opening
    }
}
```

### **🤖 AI Pattern Recognition**

#### **Usage Pattern Learning**
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Identifies common usage times and locations
- **Frequency Tracking**: Learns most common disconnect locations
- **Contextual Suggestions**: Provides recommendations based on current time and location
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improves suggestions based on successful searches

#### **Smart Recommendations**
```swift
private func generateAISuggestions() -> [String] {
    let currentHour = Calendar.current.component(.hour, from: Date())
    
    if currentHour >= 6 && currentHour <= 10 {
        return ["Check your bedside table or bathroom"]
    } else if currentHour >= 11 && currentHour <= 17 {
        return ["Look around your workspace or where you take calls"]
    }
    // Additional time-based logic...
}
```

### **💾 Data Management**

#### **Privacy-First Storage**
- **Local Storage Only**: All location data stored on device
- **20-Entry History**: Maintains recent location memory without cloud storage
- **UserDefaults Integration**: Persistent storage across app sessions
- **No Data Transmission**: Zero personal data sent to external services

#### **Location History Format**
```swift
struct AirPodsLocation: Codable {
    let id: UUID
    let coordinate: CLLocation
    let timestamp: Date
    let roomDescription: String
    let confidenceLevel: ConfidenceLevel
    let source: LocationSource
}
```
